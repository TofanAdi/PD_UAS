Fokus utama adalah pada atribut yang menggambarkan kondisi fisik dan lingkungan yang memiliki pengaruh langsung terhadap deteksi outlier dan prediksi kebakaran hutan.\n","Dengan demikian, kita akan memfokuskan preprocessing pada fitur numerik yang lebih relevan seperti suhu (Temperature), kelembaban (RH), kecepatan angin (Ws), curah hujan (Rain), dan indeks bahan bakar hutan (FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI, FWI). Dengan cara ini, model yang dibangun akan lebih akurat dan efisien dalam mendeteksi outlier dan melakukan prediksi."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"cell_id":"2cf21afa36b84e9ca69e9411954d71da","deepnote_cell_type":"code","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"execution_millis":221,"execution_start":1719437130449,"source_hash":"9c86194"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.deepnote.dataframe.v3+json":{"column_count":11,"columns":[{"dtype":"int64","name":"Temperature","stats":{"histogram":[{"bin_end":24,"bin_start":22,"count":2},{"bin_end":26,"bin_start":24,"count":9},{"bin_end":28,"bin_start":26,"count":13},{"bin_end":30,"bin_start":28,"count":33},{"bin_end":32,"bin_start":30,"count":47},{"bin_end":34,"bin_start":32,"count":44},{"bin_end":36,"bin_start":34,"count":53},{"bin_end":38,"bin_start":36,"count":30},{"bin_end":40,"bin_start":38,"count":9},{"bin_end":42,"bin_start":40,"count":4}],"max":"42","min":"22","nan_count":0,"unique_count":19}},{"dtype":"int64","name":"RH","stats":{"histogram":[{"bin_end":27.9,"bin_start":21,"count":3},{"bin_end":34.8,"bin_start":27.9,"count":7},{"bin_end":41.7,"bin_start":34.8,"count":13},{"bin_end":48.6,"bin_start":41.7,"count":24},{"bin_end":55.5,"bin_start":48.6,"count":38},{"bin_end":62.400000000000006,"bin_start":55.5,"count":34},{"bin_end":69.30000000000001,"bin_start":62.400000000000006,"count":45},{"bin_end":76.2,"bin_start":69.30000000000001,"count":32},{"bin_end":83.1,"bin_start":76.2,"count":32},{"bin_end":90,"bin_start":83.1,"count":16}],"max":"90","min":"21","nan_count":0,"unique_count":62}},{"dtype":"int64","name":"Ws","stats":{"histogram":[{"bin_end":8.3,"bin_start":6,"count":2},{"bin_end":10.6,"bin_start":8.3,"count":5},{"bin_end":12.899999999999999,"bin_start":10.6,"count":14},{"bin_end":15.2,"bin_start":12.899999999999999,"count":113},{"bin_end":17.5,"bin_start":15.2,"count":55},{"bin_end":19.799999999999997,"bin_start":17.5,"count":41},{"bin_end":22.099999999999998,"bin_start":19.799999999999997,"count":12},{"bin_end":24.4,"bin_start":22.099999999999998,"count":0},{"bin_end":26.7,"bin_start":24.4,"count":1},{"bin_end":29,"bin_start":26.7,"count":1}],"max":"29","min":"6","nan_count":0,"unique_count":18}},{"dtype":"int64","name":"Rain","stats":{"histogram":[{"bin_end":16.8,"bin_start":0,"count":218},{"bin_end":33.6,"bin_start":16.8,"count":11},{"bin_end":50.400000000000006,"bin_start":33.6,"count":7},{"bin_end":67.2,"bin_start":50.400000000000006,"count":2},{"bin_end":84,"bin_start":67.2,"count":2},{"bin_end":100.80000000000001,"bin_start":84,"count":1},{"bin_end":117.60000000000001,"bin_start":100.80000000000001,"count":1},{"bin_end":134.4,"bin_start":117.60000000000001,"count":1},{"bin_end":151.20000000000002,"bin_start":134.4,"count":0},{"bin_end":168,"bin_start":151.20000000000002,"count":1}],"max":"168","min":"0","nan_count":0,"unique_count":35}},{"dtype":"int64","name":"FFMC","stats":{"histogram":[{"bin_end":134.8,"bin_start":45,"count":27},{"bin_end":224.6,"bin_start":134.8,"count":0},{"bin_end":314.4,"bin_start":224.6,"count":2},{"bin_end":404.2,"bin_start":314.4,"count":3},{"bin_end":494,"bin_start":404.2,"count":11},{"bin_end":583.8,"bin_start":494,"count":9},{"bin_end":673.6,"bin_start":583.8,"count":22},{"bin_end":763.4,"bin_start":673.6,"count":22},{"bin_end":853.1999999999999,"bin_start":763.4,"count":57},{"bin_end":943,"bin_start":853.1999999999999,"count":91}],"max":"943","min":"45","nan_count":0,"unique_count":173}},{"dtype":"int64","name":"DMC","stats":{"histogram":[{"bin_end":68.6,"bin_start":3,"count":92},{"bin_end":134.2,"bin_start":68.6,"count":62},{"bin_end":199.79999999999998,"bin_start":134.2,"count":31},{"bin_end":265.4,"bin_start":199.79999999999998,"count":28},{"bin_end":331,"bin_start":265.4,"count":12},{"bin_end":396.59999999999997,"bin_start":331,"count":6},{"bin_end":462.19999999999993,"bin_start":396.59999999999997,"count":6},{"bin_end":527.8,"bin_start":462.19999999999993,"count":3},{"bin_end":593.4,"bin_start":527.8,"count":2},{"bin_end":659,"bin_start":593.4,"count":2}],"max":"659","min":"3","nan_count":0,"unique_count":160}},{"dtype":"float64","name":"DC","stats":{"histogram":[{"bin_end":28.25,"bin_start":6.9,"count":110},{"bin_end":49.6,"bin_start":28.25,"count":50},{"bin_end":70.95000000000002,"bin_start":49.6,"count":23},{"bin_end":92.30000000000001,"bin_start":70.95000000000002,"count":21},{"bin_end":113.65,"bin_start":92.30000000000001,"count":12},{"bin_end":135.00000000000003,"bin_start":113.65,"count":7},{"bin_end":156.35000000000002,"bin_start":135.00000000000003,"count":7},{"bin_end":177.70000000000002,"bin_start":156.35000000000002,"count":8},{"bin_end":199.05,"bin_start":177.70000000000002,"count":3},{"bin_end":220.4,"bin_start":199.05,"count":3}],"max":"220.4","min":"6.9","nan_count":0,"unique_count":198}},{"dtype":"int64","name":"ISI","stats":{"histogram":[{"bin_end":18.5,"bin_start":0,"count":100},{"bin_end":37,"bin_start":18.5,"count":38},{"bin_end":55.5,"bin_start":37,"count":32},{"bin_end":74,"bin_start":55.5,"count":23},{"bin_end":92.5,"bin_start":74,"count":20},{"bin_end":111,"bin_start":
